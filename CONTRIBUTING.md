# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to make collaboration smooth:

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your change.
2. Keep changes focused and small. One feature/fix per PR.
3. Follow existing code style (vanilla JS, semantic HTML, and CSS variables).
4. Write descriptive commit messages and reference any related issue.
5. Add screenshots or a short video when the PR affects UI/UX.

Pull requests will be reviewed within a few days. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
