Placeholders for images used by the scaffold.

Please add the following images to replace placeholders:
- headshot-placeholder.png  (your headshot, recommended 600x600 px)
 - headshot-placeholder.png  (your headshot, recommended 600x600 px)
- project-placeholder.png   (generic project screenshot)
 - NOTE: The site now uses `resources/profile-me.png` for the hero headshot and `resources/profile-logo.svg` for the header logo. Replace those files in the `resources/` folder with your real images.
