# Python Code Practices

This repository is a curated collection of Python code practices and exercises based on CodeWithHarry's tutorials. It includes examples for variables, control structures, functions, lists, dictionaries, file I/O, and introductory OOP.

It serves as a learning journal and practice area; useful content for the 'practice' section of the portfolio.
